      <h2 className="title">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Preston Polston, and I am an aspiring Full Stack Engineer
        based in Atlanta, GA. With a strong foundation in both front-end and
        back-end development, I am proficient in technologies such as
        JavaScript, React/Redux, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. My professional
        journey has equipped me with leadership skills gained during my military
        service, where I developed a detail-oriented approach and a passion for
        problem-solving, which I now seek to apply in the tech industry as I
        pursue a career in software development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have successfully developed several projects, including Metalsite, a
        full-stack e-commerce platform that integrates a comprehensive user
        database, and Light Tracker, an ongoing project designed to track
        lighting resources on film sets. These experiences have not only
        solidified my technical skills but have also taught me the importance of
        collaboration and effective communication in delivering quality results
        within a team-driven environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a Software Engineering Certificate from Fullstack Academy, I have
        honed my coding abilities while learning to adapt quickly to new
        technologies. My prior experience as a Lighting Programmer and Rigging
        Foreman has equipped me with strong leadership qualities and the ability
        to thrive under pressure. I am enthusiastic about bringing my diverse
        background, technical knowledge, and commitment to excellence to future
        challenges in the software engineering field.
